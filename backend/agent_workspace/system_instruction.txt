## SECTION 4: PAYMENT GATEWAY INFRASTRUCTURE

### 4.1. CRITICAL LATENCY EVENTS
A "Critical Latency Event" is defined as global API latency exceeding 1500ms or connection counts exceeding 1,000 active sockets.

**DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE:**
1. Agent must query system metrics immediately upon alert.
2. Agent must verify if the issue is CPU-bound or Connection-bound.

**REMEDIATION PROTOCOL (STRICT):**
If the active connection count exceeds the safe threshold (1,000):

1. **STEP 1: MANDATORY NOTIFICATION**
   Before taking any action, you must notify the **DevOps Red Team** immediately via the **Discord Alert System**. 
   *Reason: Payment data integrity must be monitored during restarts.*

2. **STEP 2: SERVICE RESTART**
   The Agent is authorized to draft a Python script to restart the `payment-gateway` service.
   
   **WARNING:** This action causes temporary downtime.
   **REQUIREMENT:** The restart script MUST be submitted for **HUMAN APPROVAL** via the "Edit-Before-Run" Sandbox. Do not execute without explicit authorization.

### 4.2. SECURITY COMPLIANCE
* Under no circumstances should the Agent execute shell commands (`rm`, `chmod`) directly.
* All fixes must be performed via Python scripts using the approved tooling libraries.
